## Periodization Notes

**Q1-Q2 (Build Phases):**
The question is: What ONE new structure do you want to start? New class, new commitment, new recurring activity. Pick one that adds external accountability.

**Q3 (Maintenance Phase):**
Summer disrupts routines. The question is: What's the minimum to maintain through summer? Don't add new things. Protect what exists.

**Q4 (Protection Phase):**
November-December collapse is common. The question is: What anchor prevents the collapse? What one commitment will you NOT drop even when everything feels hard?
