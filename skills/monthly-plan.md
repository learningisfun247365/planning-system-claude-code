# Monthly Planning Skill

## Purpose

The monthly sit-down that synthesizes the past month, plans content for the next, and books Quality of Life activities. This is a 2-hour session that includes reflection, content planning, QoL booking, and the [partner] email.

**Core insight:** If it's not scheduled, it doesn't happen. This skill protects relationship, self-care, community, and creative work from being crowded out.

## When to Use

- **Timing:** 3rd or 4th Sunday of the month (not too early, not too late - allows current month data while leaving time to act)
- User says "monthly planning", "book the month", "monthly review"
- After quarterly planning (for first month of new quarter)

## The Process (2 hours total)

### Phase 1: Monthly Synthesis (30 min)

#### Step 1: Gather Weekly Reflections

Identify the weekly reflection files for the current month (typically 4-5 files).

Ask:
> "What month are we reviewing and planning for?"

Read each weekly reflection file from that month.

#### Step 2: Surface Patterns

Analyze the weekly reflections for:

**Recurring themes:**
- What topics/ideas came up multiple weeks?
- What questions kept appearing?
- What [[wikilinks]] were referenced repeatedly?

**Energy patterns:**
- Which weeks felt energized vs. depleted?
- What activities/work got attention?
- What got neglected or dropped?

**Open threads:**
- Unfinished thoughts or projects
- Questions raised but not answered
- Ideas that need development

Output:
> **Month Synthesis: [Month]**
>
> **Recurring themes this month:**
> - [Theme 1]: Appeared [X] times
> - [Theme 2]: Appeared [X] times
>
> **Energy patterns:**
> - High energy weeks: [which, what was different]
> - Low energy weeks: [which, what was happening]
>
> **What got attention:**
> - [Domain/project that got energy]
>
> **What got neglected:**
> - [Domain/project that didn't get attention]
>
> **Open threads to carry forward:**
> - [Question or idea needing attention]
> - [Unfinished project]
>
> **Wikilinks referenced (potential evergreen ideas):**
> - [[link1]]
> - [[link2]]

#### Step 3: Reflection Prompts

Prompt user to reflect (don't answer for them):

> **Month Reflection Questions:**
> 1. What's one thing you're proud of from this month?
> 2. What pattern do you see in the energy fluctuations?
> 3. What got neglected that you want to prioritize next month?
> 4. Is there an open thread that's ready to become an article or project?
> 5. How did this month serve your identity focus?
>
> Take 5-10 minutes to think through these before we move to content planning.

**PAUSE.** Wait for user to reflect before Phase 2.

---

### Phase 2: Content Planning (30 min)

#### Step 4: Review What's On Deck

Read the editorial calendar and drafts folder.

Output:
> **Content Status:**
>
> **Drafts in progress:**
> - [Draft 1]: [status - how close to ready?]
> - [Draft 2]: [status]
>
> **Editorial calendar for next month:**
> | Date | Topic | Status |
> |------|-------|--------|
> | [Date] | [Topic or gap] | [Idea/Draft/Ready] |
> | [Date] | [Topic or gap] | [Idea/Draft/Ready] |
> | [Date] | [Topic or gap] | [Idea/Draft/Ready] |
> | [Date] | [Topic or gap] | [Idea/Draft/Ready] |
>
> **Gaps needing topics:** [X] weeks

#### Step 5: Ideas Review

Read the ideas inbox and show what's available:

> **Ideas Inbox:**
> - [Idea 1]: [one-line description]
> - [Idea 2]: [one-line description]
> - [Idea 3]: [one-line description]
>
> Any of these ready to slot into the gaps?

#### Step 6: Content Decisions

Prompt decisions:

> **Content Planning Questions:**
> 1. Which drafts will you finish this month?
> 2. What topics should fill the editorial calendar gaps?
> 3. Any ideas from this month's synthesis that could become articles?
> 4. What's the ONE piece that matters most next month?
>
> Let's update the editorial calendar with your decisions.

Update `editorial-calendar.md` with the assigned topics.

**PAUSE.** Confirm content plan before Phase 3.

### Phase 3: Quality of Life Booking (45 min)

#### Step 7: Cultural Activities Research

First, read `cultural-activities-ideas.md` and surface what's already captured:

> "Here's what's in your cultural activities ideas list:
> - Theater: [list any items]
> - Music: [list any items]
> - Art: [list any items]
> - [etc.]
>
> Any of these happening next month?"

Then prompt additional research:

> "Anything else to research? Spend 10-15 minutes checking:
> - What shows or performances are happening next month? (theater, music, comedy)
> - What museum exhibits are open?
> - Any special events, gallery openings, workshops?
>
> Add anything interesting to the ideas list, then come back with 2-3 options for this month."

**WAIT** for input before proceeding.

#### Step 8: Date Night Booking

> "Let's schedule date nights for [month].
>
> Looking at the calendar:
> - How many date nights? (Target: 2-4)
> - Any weeks blocked by travel/commitments?
> - What days typically work best?"

For each date night:
- Date
- Type (dinner, activity, cultural event, home date)
- Reservations needed?

**If zero date nights:**
> "No date nights scheduled. This is a warning sign - relationship quality suffers without intentional time. Can we get at least one on the calendar?"

#### Step 9: Body Rituals

> "Body rituals. Standard is massage + facial each month.
>
> - Massage scheduled?
> - Facial scheduled?
> - Other body care? (Hair, acupuncture, etc.)"

**If nothing scheduled:**
> "No body rituals scheduled. This is self-care that prevents burnout. At least one?"

#### Step 10: Friend/Community Time

> "Community time. The pattern shows: without scheduled social engagement, community domain collapses.
>
> - Standing dates with friends this month?
> - Hosting anything? (dinner, game night, etc.)
> - Group activities? (classes, clubs)"

**Warning sign check:**
If 2+ consecutive weeks have no social plans:
> "I see a gap of [X] weeks without social plans. This is a warning sign. Can we add something - even a simple coffee date?"

---

### Phase 4: [Partner] Email (15 min)

#### Step 11: Draft [Partner] Email

Read `partner-monthly-emails.md` for format/history.

> "Time for the [partner] email. Pull together:
>
> **Date night options** (from what you just booked):
> - [Date]: [Plan]
> - [Date]: [Plan]
>
> **Couple projects/decisions** to discuss:
> - [Any ongoing house stuff, trip planning, etc.]
>
> **Questions for [partner]:**
> - [Anything needing their input]"

Prompt user to draft and send the email.

#### Step 12: Mark Email Sent

Update `partner-monthly-emails.md`:
```
## [Month] [YEAR]
**Status:** SENT
**Date sent:** [Date]
**Key items:**

## Boundaries

### This Skill Does:
- Synthesize weekly reflections into monthly patterns
- Surface what got attention vs. neglected
- Guide content planning from ideas to editorial calendar
- Walk through QoL booking category by category
- Create the [partner] email
- Generate the month plan file

### This Skill Does NOT:
- Browse the web for events (user does research)
- Make actual reservations (prompts user to book)
- Write articles (that's a separate writing skill)
- Interpret patterns (shows data, user reflects)
- Replace the thinking

---

## Voice

Direct and protective. This session protects quality of life:

> "I know 2 hours feels like a lot, but this is how the month actually works vs. just happens to you. Let's invest the time now."

On warning signs:
> "No date nights and no friend plans. I'm flagging this as a risk. The pattern shows this leads to relationship strain and isolation. What's one thing we can add?"

On content:
> "You have 4 posts next month and topics for 2 of them. That means 2 weeks of 'figure it out later' - which usually means stress. Let's slot something in now."

---

## Warning Sign Triggers

Flag explicitly:
- Zero date nights in a month
- 2+ weeks without scheduled social engagement
- No body rituals scheduled
- Editorial calendar gaps with no plan
- Month synthesis showing same thing neglected 2+ months in a row

---

## Chains To

After completing monthly planning:

> "Month is planned. Weekly rhythm kicks in. Run `/weekly-plan` each Sunday."

At end of month 3 of quarter:

> "This is month 3 of Q[X]. Next monthly planning will include quarterly planning. Block 3 hours instead of 2."
